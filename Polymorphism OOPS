Polymorphism: one entity in many forms or one functionality acts differently in different 
              classes/same class.

in java programming polymorphism again divided into two types,

1. static/compile time polymorphism: to implement this polymorphism we uses 'overloading' concept

=> we use 'constructor overloading and method overloading' to implement/achieve 
   static/compile time polymorphism

2. dynamic/runtime polymorphism: to implement this polymorphism we uses 'overriding' concept

=> we use 'method overriding' to implement/achieve 
   dynamic/runtime polymorphism.
